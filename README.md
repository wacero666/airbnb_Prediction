# airbnb_PricePrediction

Welcome to our AirBnB prediction project using R!

Travel related datasets have always brought me a lot of excitment to explore. In this project, given the related information of each listing on Airbnb, we trained our models to predict price and desirability, which are regression and classification models respectively. 

We had lots of fun from [data cleaning,feature engineer](https://github.com/wacero666/airbnb_Prediction/blob/master/Preprocess_EDA.Rmd), [model selection](https://github.com/wacero666/airbnb_Prediction/blob/master/Model_Exploration_review.Rmd) to [model tunning](https://github.com/wacero666/airbnb_Prediction/blob/master/XGboost_model_review.Rmd)!
